# Module 19 Challenge - neural-network-challenge-2
## Description
This code creates a branched neural network that HR can use to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company, as well as predicts the department that best fits each employee. We were given a number of features to chose from to help predict these outcomes. The NN consists of an input layer, two dense layers, two hidden layers, and two output layers. We find that we are able to predict the department for each employee with better accuracy.
